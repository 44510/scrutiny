# Commented Scrutiny Configuration File
#
# The default location for this file is ~/scrutiny.yaml.
# In some cases to improve clarity default values are specified,
# uncommented. Other example values are commented out.
#
# When this file is parsed by Scrutiny, all configuration file keys are
# lowercased automatically. As such, Configuration keys are case-insensitive,
# and should be lowercase in this file to be consistent with usage.
